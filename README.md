> [!important]
> This plugin is powered by WordServe's [Go library](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve)!

#### What's it about?

<table>
<tr>
<td>

WordServe is a minimalistic and high performance **prefix Autocompletion plugin** written in Go.

#### Why?

So many tools and apps I use on daily basis do not offer any form of word completion, AI/NLP driven or otherwise, there are times when I need to quickly find a word or phrase that I know exists in my vocabulary, but I have no idea how to spell it or don't feel like typing for _that_ long.

Why not make my own tool that can power any TS/JS/etc clients with a completion server?

#### Similar to?

Think of this as a elementary nvim-cmp or vscode Intellisense daemon, but for any plugin/app that can use a MessagePack client. (which is super [easy to implement](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@msgpack/msgpack) and use compared to JSON parsing btw, in fact, about **411%** [improvement in speed](https://halilibrahimkocaoz.medium.com/message-queues-messagepack-vs-json-for-serialization-749914e3d0bb) and **40%** reduction in payload sizes)

> This is my first attempt on creating a small scaled but usable Go server/library. Expect unstable or incomplete features, as well as some bugs.
> I primarily made this for myself so I can make a completion plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) but hey, you might find it useful too!

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install) or later
- [Luajit 2.1](https://luajit.org/install.html) _(only for dictionary build scripts)_
  - A simple `words.txt` file for building the dictionary with most used words and their corresponding frequencies <span style="color: #908caa;"> -- see [dictionary](#dictionary) for more info</span>

## Installation

### Go

using `go install` _(Recommended)_:

```sh
go install github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/cmd/wordserve@latest
```

#### Library Dependency

use `go get` to add `wordserve` as a dependency in your project:

```sh
go get github.com/bastiangx/wordserve
```

and then import it in your code:

```go
import "github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/pkg/suggest"
```

### Releases

 Download the latest precompiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/releases/latest).

- `wordserve` automatically downloads and initializes the needed dictionary files from GitHub releases
- The dictionary files (`dict_*.bin`) are packaged in `data.zip` and the word list (`words.txt`) is available as a separate download
- If automatic download fails, you can manually download `data.zip` and `words.txt` from the [releases page](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/releases/latest) and extract them to the `data/` directory

> If you're not sure, use 'go install'.

### Building from source

You can also clone via git and build the old fashioned way:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve.git
cd wordserve
# -w -s strips debug info & symbols | alias wserve
go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o wserve ./cmd/wordserve/main.go
```

The build process for the dict files is handled by the `wordserve` binary, If you encounter any issues, you can manually run the build script located in `scripts/build-data.lua` using [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/).

> Make sure the `data/` directory exists and has the `words.txt` file in it before running this.

```sh
luajit scripts/build-data.lua
```

## What can it do?

### Batched Word Suggestions

      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/h26n6q.png">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/h26n6q.png"/>
    </picture>

<br />

WordServe returns suggestions in batches using a radix trie. Memory pools handle rapid queries without triggering garbage collection.

<br />

### Responsive

      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/8emcdr.png"/>
    </picture>

<br />

The IPC server communicates through stdin/stdout channels with minimal protocol overhead.

Goroutines handle multiple client connections simultaneously.

<br />

### Capital letters

      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/69eg4f.gif" alt="a gif video showing wordserve suggestions engine handling capital letters properly" />
    </picture>

<br />

It just works

### Compact MessagePack Protocol

 <picture>
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/vlkcqa.png">
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/7kwkwk.png">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/7kwkwk.png"/>
    </picture>

<br />

Binary MessagePack encoding keeps request and response payloads as small as possible.

<br />

### Many Many Words

 <picture>
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/z463kh.png">
      <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/w4cn0v.png">
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/w4cn0v.png"/>
    </picture>

<br />

Start with a simple `words.txt` file containing 65,000+ entries.

WordServe chunks the dictionary into binary trie files and loads only what's needed, dynamically managing memory based on usage patterns.

<br />

### Small memory usage

<picture>
      <source srcset="https://files.catbox.moe/nv7r2x.gif" />
      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/nv7r2x.gif" alt="Memory usage of WordServe shown to be around 20MB with 50K words loaded in" />
    </picture>

<br />

WordServe's memory usage remains low even with large dictionaries, typically around 20MB for 50,000 words default.
Even after expanding many nodes and normal usage for few hours, it stays under 60MB and has checks to shrink periodically.

## What can it _not_ do?

As this is the early version and Beta, there are _many_ features that are yet not implemented

- simple fuzzy matching
- string searching algo (haystack-needle)
- integrated spelling correction (aspell)
- support conventional dict formats like `.dict`

Will monitor the issues and usage to see if enough people are interested.

## Usage

### Standalone server

you can run `wordserve` as a dependency in your Go project, a standalone IPC server.
A simple CLI is also provided for testing and debugging.

### Library

The library provides simple to use API for prefix completion requests and dictionary management.

Read all about using them in the [API doc](docs/api.md)

More comprehensive and verbose [Go Package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/pkg/suggest)

```go
completer := suggest.NewLazyCompleter("./data", 10000, 50000)

if err := completer.Initialize(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize: %v", err)
}

suggestions := completer.Complete("amer", 10)
```

or for static check:

```go
completer := suggest.NewCompleter()

completer.AddWord("example", 500)
completer.AddWord("excellent", 400)

suggestions := completer.Complete("ex", 5)
```

### Client Integration

The [Client doc](docs/client.md) gives some guide on how to use WordServe in your TS/JS app.

```ts
import { spawn, ChildProcess } from 'child_process';
import { encode, decode } from '@msgpack/msgpack';

class WordServeClient {
  private process: ChildProcess;
  private requestId = 0;

  constructor(binaryPath: string = 'wordserve') {
    this.process = spawn(binaryPath, [], {
      stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']
    });
  }

  async getCompletions(prefix: string, limit: number = 20): Promise<Suggestion[]> {
    const request = {
      id: `req_${++this.requestId}`,
      p: prefix,
      l: limit      // (optional)
    };

    const binaryRequest = encode(request);
    this.process.stdin!.write(binaryRequest);

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.process.stdout!.once('data', (data: Buffer) => {
        try {
          const response = decode(data) as CompletionResponse;
          const suggestions = response.s.map((s, index) => ({
            word: s.w,
            rank: s.r,
            frequency: 65536 - s.r // Convert rank back to freq score
          }));
          resolve(suggestions);
        } catch (error) {
          reject(error);
        }
      });
    });
  }
}
```

  - <span style="color: #908caa;">  Its a great extension to use on browsers, but I wanted something that can be used basically in any electron/local webapps with plugin clients, but also make it wayyy faster and more efficient since the depeendencies used there are way too bloated (C++ ...) and had too many bindings for my liking, and also more imporatantly, make this a good practice for me to learn how radix tries work for prefixes.</span>
