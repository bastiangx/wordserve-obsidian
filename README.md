#### What's it about?

<table>
<tr>
<td>

WordServe is a minimalistic and high performance **Autocompletion plugin** written in Go.
It suggests top ranking words when typing and exapnsions on abbreviations! simple.
You can insert them by pressing `Tab` or `Enter` (or pressing the digit keys for vim users ;) )

#### Why?

So many desktop tools and apps I use on daily basis do not offer any form of word completion, AI/NLP driven or otherwise, there are times when I need to quickly find a word or phrase that I know exists in my vocabulary, but I don't feel like typing for _that_ long.

#### Similar to?

Think of this as a basic nvim-cmp or vscode Intellisense daemon.
Suggestions menu appear when typing any words + Expansions on text via abbreviations, defined and customisable by you.

> I quite frankly made this for myself so I can have a USABLE completion plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) but hey, you might find it handy too!
> its still missing some big features like having auto correction and spelling, might add them if people find this actually useful.

Start with a simple `words.txt` file containing 65,000+ entries.

WordServe chunks the dictionary into binary trie files and loads only what's needed, 
managing memory based on usage patterns.

## Installation

### Obsidian

Open the _Community plugins_ tab, browse and search for `WordServe`

#### Building and development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve-obsidian.git
cd wordserve-obsidian
bun i
bun run dev
```

place cloned folder inside Obsidina's plugins directory, Obsidian should load it autmatically by clicking the community plugin's refersh button

```
~/username/Documents/Vault/.obsidian/plugins/
```

> The initial build for dictionary files are handled by the `wordserve` binary itself, If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Go library](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve)

> Make sure the `data/` directory exists and has the `words.txt` file in it.

> [!important]
> This repo is powered by WordServe's own [Go library](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve)! check it out if you want to see how the prefixes are actually processed

### DISCLAIMERS

1. The core components **ARE DOWNLOADED FROM GITHUB** via the release versions noted, if plugin version is for example `v0.1.2`, it will only download the `v0.1.2` binaries from [WordServe' repo](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve) -- (no mechanisms of auto updating)
   - These binaries include the `wordserve` Go executable, a `words.txt` file and the dictionary files needed for this to work.
   - all fetching impls are done in [downloader.ts file](./src/core/downloader.ts)
   - If you have any issues with the fetching, you can manually get them from the [releases page](https://github.com/bastiangx/wordserve/releases/latest)

2. WordServe does not track any usage data, analytics, telemetry or provide any internal methods of tracking activities to external connections.
   - The `words.txt` file is a simple text file containing a list of words, phrases and abbreviations.
   - precompiled dictionary files are generated from the `words.txt` file and are used to provide autosuggestions.

  - <span style="color: #908caa;">  Its a great extension to use on browsers, but I wanted something that can be used basically in any electron/local webapps with plugin clients, but also make it wayyy faster and more efficient since the depeendencies used there are way too bloated (C++ ...) and had too many bindings for my liking, and also more imporatantly, make this a good practice for me to learn how radix tries work for prefixes.</span>
